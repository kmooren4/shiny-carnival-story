	Today was the day! Little Billy had been counting down for weeks and finally this bright and sunny morning was the one he had been waiting for. Today was the day that the Shiny Carnival was coming to town. Billy had seen the fliers for weeks, advertising the fun games, exciting rides, and delicious food that would be present. He could not wait for that afternood when his mom would take him!
