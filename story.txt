	Today was the day! Little Billy had been counting down for weeks and finally this bright and sunny morning was the one he had been waiting for. Today was the day that the Shiny Carnival was coming to town. Billy had seen the fliers for weeks, advertising the fun games, exciting rides, and delicious food that would be present. He could not wait for that afternood when his mom would take him!
	It was afternoon and after a short drive, Billy and his mom arrived to
the carnival. He could barely contain his excitement as he bounced up and down
while waiting in line before the admission booth. Entering the carnival, Billy
was awed by all attractions around him. "Mom!", Billy began, "I want to go on
all the rides, play all the games, eat a bunch of cotton candy, and..!"
Chuckling at her son's uncontained zeal, Billy's mom reassured him that he can
do as many things as he wanted, but first, he has to decide what to start with.
Pondering for a bit, Billy replied, "The UFO! That one first!" And so, Billy
and his mom headed to the out-of-this-world ride.
